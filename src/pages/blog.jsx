          On the north side of Madeira Island, you can find a mysterious fog
          creating an incredible atmosphere amongst the trees of Fanal Forest. The
          twisted branches of the grand centenary Ocotea Foetens trees and the fog
          come together in this fairytale scene. In this blog post, I will share
          with you the details about what to expect at Fanal, how to get there,
          the different walks, hikes, and viewpoints in the region, and some
          photography tips for Fanal.

    <p className="mx-auto my-6 ">
          Located on the north-western end of Madeira Island, the Fanal Forest is
          quite easy to find as it has a dedicated parking area called ‘Faial
          Parking’ on Google Maps. Here you can park your car and walk a few
          hundred meters straight into the forest or to visit the nearby
          viewpoint, which is also just a few hundred meters away from the parking
          lot. From Funchal, it will take you one hour via car.

        <h1 className="text-3xl mx-auto">BEST TIME TO VISIT FANAL FOREST</h1>
    <p className="mx-auto my-6 ">
          The Fanal Forest is great to visit all year round but there are certain
          weather conditions that make this place quite atmospheric. Basically,
          you want the entire forest to be engulfed by fog to create this
          mystical, moody vibe that you can see in my photos. It is common for fog
          to hit this area, which is 1,150 meters above sea level. It can be quite
          hard to predict when it will be clear and when it will be foggy. Often
          if it is clear and sunny at sea level down by the beach, it can still be
          foggy conditions in the forest.<br /><br />
          The best tip I can offer is that it is said to be more likely to get
          foggy conditions in the morning rather than in the evening. We chose a
          day when it had been foggy for a few days up in the mountains and then
          went for sunrise the next morning. It was even a little too foggy and
          windy for us but we were grateful the fog rolled in and created this
          stunning scene. As you can see below, I’ve included a photo of the Fanal
          Forest in foggy conditions and also of when I visited after the Levada
          dos Cedros hike when it was clear and sunny. Big difference.

    <p className="mx-auto my-6 ">
          This ancient laurel forest of Fanal is found in the northwest of Madeira
          island. It’s renowned for its alluring beauty eerie atmosphere. You will
          be met by a dense canopy of trees as you enter the forest, which will
          filter the light and produce a softer, more ethereal glow. It feels
          otherworldly because of the thick layer of moss that covers the forest
          floor and the fog that commonly rolls through the region.<br /><br />
  
          Several hiking trails with varying degrees of difficulty can be found as
          you meander through the forest. There is a trail for everyone,
          experienced or novice hikers alike. Be on the lookout for the well-known
          “fairy tale trees,” which are old laurel trees with twisted and
          contorted branches that resemble something from a fairy tale.<br /><br />
  
          The Fanal Forest takes on a completely different personality at night. A
          mystical and ethereal atmosphere is created when the forest is enveloped
          in mist and the moonlight and starlight pass through the trees. It’s the
          ideal time to go on a guided night hike through the forest, where you
          can discover the magic of the forest at dusk. Even some nocturnal
          creatures found in the forest, like owls or bats, may be visible to
          you.<br /><br />
  
          In conclusion, the Fanal Forest is a must-see location for visitors to
          Madeira. It’s the ideal location to get back in touch with nature and
          get away from the stresses of everyday life because of its serene
          beauty, magical atmosphere, and limitless opportunities for adventure.
          You’ll undoubtedly feel revitalized and inspired after exploring the
          Fanal Forest on foot, whether you hike through it during the day or go
          on a guided night hike.<br /><br />

        <h1 className="text-3xl mx-auto">HISTORY OF THE UNESCO FANAL FOREST</h1>
    <p className="mx-auto my-6 ">
          A UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Laurissilva Forest includes a section
          on Madeira Island called the Fanal Forest. A variety of plant and animal
          species can be found in this subtropical forest, which is about 15,000
          hectares in size. Some of the plant species are unique to Madeira
          Island. Laurel trees, the forest’s dominant species, are what give the
          forest its distinctive appearance. <br /><br />
  
          The Canary laurel, Madeira laurel, and Bay laurel are some of the laurel
          species that can be found in the Fanal Forest. These tall trees, whose
          height can reach 40 meters, have broad leaves that absorb moisture from
          the persistent mist that covers the forest. Because of the laurel trees,
          the forest has a special atmosphere with high humidity and relatively
          constant temperatures all year long. Ferns, mosses, and lichens, among
          other plant and animal species, can all thrive in this environment.
          Numerous bird species, including the Laurel Pigeon and the Madeira
          Firecrest, which are both endemic to the island of Madeira, can be found
          in the Fanal Forest.

        <h1 className="text-3xl mx-auto">PHOTOGRAPHY IN FANAL FOREST</h1>
    <p className="mx-auto my-6 ">Fanal Forest is an incredible location for photography. The twisted branches of the trees create a scene straight out of a horror movie. This is especially true when the fog is rolling through, giving that eerie atmosphere to the landscape. In terms of photography in Fanal it really depends on how much fog there is for what type of photos you might be able to create.</p>
        <img className="mx-auto my-6 "
        src="/bl3.jpg"
        alt="Fanal Forest, Madeira"
         />
        <p className="mx-auto my-6 ">I wanted to capture some images with the entire trees and small people beneath them but the fog was so strong on the day I visited, that the quality of my images suffered a little bit. I began shooting with a 24-105mm lens. I didn’t even bother to take out my 400mm as the fog was too thick for a long-distance telephoto shot. In the end, I quickly switched to my 16-35mm, which meant I could get closer to my subject and avoid the quality loss due to the thick fog between myself and the subject.</p>

    <p className="mx-auto my-6 ">Having a person in the frame at this location can help to give some scale to the trees but I also loved the moody shots of the twisted trees without any human element.</p>
